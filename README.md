# xr-usb-serial

This repository contains drivers downloaded from https://www.maxlinear.com/support/design-tools/software-drivers
along with patches to those drivers.
Because those drivers are not stored in git, understanding the diffs between them can be difficult.
For that reason, this repository contains different versions of the same driver in an attempt to capture exactly the contents of each version byte for byte.
